Reference [23] proved that we can compute the same blur filter f in both cases.
R[2]gives so a brilliant abstraction of the most popular methods deconvolution and artifact minimization in the software industry.
R[5] this textbook provides early and basic approaches usually assume a priori knowledge to estimate the blur filter in deblurring the input image.
R[4]propose  a variational Bayesian approach using an assumption on the statistical property of the image gradient distribution to approximate the unblurred image.
R[25] propose a lot of algorithm for deblurring image
